🔌 HOW TO CONNECT CONSTANT CONTACT

STEP 1: Create a Form in Constant Contact

1. Log in to your Constant Contact account
2. Go to Contacts → Sign-up Forms
3. Click Create → Inline Form or Pop-up Form
4. Design your form (or use a simple template)
5. Click Save & Publish

STEP 2: Get Your Form Embed Code or API Endpoint

Option A: Using Constant Contact's Form Action URL

1. After creating the form, click Get Code
2. Look for the <form action="..."> line in the embed code
3. Copy the URL in the action attribute
4. Example: https://visitor2.constantcontact.com/api/signup

Option B: Using Constant Contact API (Advanced)

1. Go to Account → API Keys
2. Generate an API key
3. Use the Constant Contact API to submit contacts

STEP 3: Update Your Website Code

Open scripts.js and find line 262:

const constantContactFormURL = 'YOUR_CONSTANT_CONTACT_FORM_URL_HERE';

Replace with your actual Constant Contact form URL:

const constantContactFormURL = 'https://visitor2.constantcontact.com/api/signup?YOUR_FORM_ID';

Then UNCOMMENT lines 266-281 (remove the /* and */):

const formData = new FormData();
formData.append('email', email);
formData.append('first_name', name);

fetch(constantContactFormURL, {
    method: 'POST',
    body: formData,
    mode: 'no-cors'
}).then(() => {
    handleSuccessfulSubmission();
}).catch((error) => {
    console.error('Error:', error);
    alert('There was an error. Please try again.');
});

And COMMENT OUT line 284:

// handleSuccessfulSubmission(); // Remove this line or comment it out

STEP 4: Create Your Free Prompt Delivery

You need to create the 50 FREE prompts to deliver to new subscribers:

Option 1: Automated Email via Constant Contact

1. In Constant Contact, create an Automated Welcome Email
2. Set it to trigger when someone joins your list
3. Include a download link to your free prompts (PDF or Google Doc)

Option 2: Use a Service Like Gumroad

1. Create a FREE product on Gumroad with your 50 prompts
2. Set up an automation to send the link when someone subscribes
